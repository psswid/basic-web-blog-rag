    "Q1": "Based on the provided content, the cost to convert text to speech using OpenAI is not explicitly mentioned in the blog articles. However, the information given does state that OpenAI API works on tokens, and a token is approximately 4 characters or an English word.\n\nGiven that 2000 characters would roughly translate to 500 tokens (since 2000 / 4 = 500), you would need to know the cost per token for OpenAI's text-to-speech service to calculate the total cost. Unfortunately, this specific rate is not provided in the articles. \n\nTo get an accurate cost, you would need to refer to OpenAI's pricing information on their official website or platform, particularly the pricing details related to their text-to-speech API.",
